## Learnig resources

At the beginning of the project I only knew the basic concepts of Angular, having mainly worked with Vue.js, the concepts related to Single page applications were already acquired. The following list regroups additional resources I have used to explore the different technologies used.

* Learning angular advanced concepts :
    * [Angular official documentation](https://angular.io/docs) provides some advanced tutorials to angular concepts.
    * [AngularFire docs](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2) explain how to work efficiently with angular and firebase.
    * [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io/) : many tutorials about all the angular ecosystem.
